        Video game genres classify games based on their gameplay mechanics, setting, and goals, helping players understand what kind of experience to expect. Common genres include action, role-playing (RPG), and strategy, each offering different styles of play, like fast-paced combat, narrative exploration, or puzzle-solving. Some games blend genres to offer unique experiences.<br><br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>, a popular digital game platform, categorizes its vast library by these genres, making it easier for players to discover games that match their preferences.
